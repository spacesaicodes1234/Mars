        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is a dusty, cold, desert world
        with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons,
        polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even
        more active in the past.Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our
        solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the
        alien landscape. NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and
        Perseverance),one lander (InSight), and one helicopter(Ingenuity)
        exploring the surface of Mars.

        Its surface is rocky, with canyons, volcanoes, dry lake beds and craters all over it. Red dust covers most of its surface. Mars has clouds and wind just like Earth. Sometimes the wind blows the red dust into a dust storm. Tiny dust storms can look like tornados, and large ones can be seen from Earth. Mars’ large storms sometimes cover the entire planet.

        Running from the eastern flanks of the rise, roughly along the equator, is Valles Marineris. This is a split in the Martian crust 4000 kilometres long (about a fifth of the distance around the whole of Mars), up to 600 kilometres wide and seven kilometres deep. The Grand Canyon is a mere 450 kilometres long, up to 29 kilometres wide and 1.6 kilometres deep.

It has the highest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons which stands at 26 kilometres above the surrounding plain: Mount Everest is only one third as high.

        1) Named after the Roman God of war, Mars is the fourth planet from the sun in our solar system.
        <br>
        <br>  
        2) Mars is also known as the ‘Red Planet’ because, well, it’s red! This signature colour comes from the large amount of a chemical called iron oxide (or ‘rust’ as you might know it) in its rocks and soil.
        <br>
        <br> 
        3) Mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system after Mercury. With a diameter (distance through the middle) of 6,791 kilometres, it’s roughly half the size of Earth.
        <br>
        <br> 
        4) It can get pretty cold on Mars –– much colder than our own planet, since it’s further away from the sun. At the equator, temperatures can reach 20°C, but at its poles they can plummet to as low as -140°C.
        <br>
        <br> 
        5)  Mars is home to the highest mountain in our solar system –– a volcano called Olympus Mons. Standing a whopping 24 kilometres high, it’s about three times the height of Mount Everest!
